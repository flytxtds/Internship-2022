# Data Science Intership Opportunities at Flytxt R&D(May-July 2022)
We are looking for self-motivated individuals with a passion to solve real-world problems in emerging areas of machine learning/AI including federated privacy preserving machine learning and explainable AI. You will be responsible to design, code, test and deploy PoCs which demonstrate the value in applying these advanced techniques on usecases in customer experience management. You would be working in a fast-paced environment, and would need to pick up concepts through a combination of self-learning and your assigned mentor's guidance. Please note that this will be a remote internship program.

**Who can apply?**
1. Students in 3rd/4th year B.Tech program in Computer Science or a related discipline (Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Electrical and/or Computer Engineering) with a focus on Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning. Final year M.Tech/MS/Ph.D students from the above disciplines are also eligible.
2. Should be passionate about advanced machine learning/AI.
3. Should be able to devote a minimum of 2 months, starting May 2022

| 1  | Privacy preserving federated learning on tabular data | Create a federated privacy preserving model to predict if a bank customer will subscribe to a term-deposit or not by securely combining customer & marketing data which is split across two banks, without requiring data sharing in plain. Both banks have the same set of customer KPIs, but non-overlapping customers (horizontal federated learning).

The model should be built using Federated Secure XGBoost, an open-source project from UC Berkeley RISE Lab (https://github.com/mc2-project/secure-xgboost)  | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
